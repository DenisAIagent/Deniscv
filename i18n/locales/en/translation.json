    "texte": "With solid management experience, I spent 5 years at John Paul leading a team of 7 concierges. During this period, I structured the team by implementing complete coaching, onboarding, continuous training, and personalized support processes, developing strong leadership and talent development skills.\n\nSimultaneously, since 2018, I founded and run my digital marketing agency, MDMC Music Ads. We support over a hundred clients in strategic development and online fanbase engagement.\n\nOur digital expertise has generated tangible results: over 1,500 campaigns launched, 34 million cumulative views, and solid engagement rates between 4 and 8%. My specialty: transforming interest into a loyal and active fan community.\n\nToday, I put this dual expertise - managerial and digital -, data-driven and results-oriented, at the service of structuring your teams and growing your project."
