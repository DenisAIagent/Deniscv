During that time, I built the team from the ground up, implementing full coaching, onboarding, continuous training, and personalized support processes—developing advanced skills in leadership and talent development.\n\nIn parallel, since 2018, I have founded and run my digital marketing agency, MDMC Music Ads. We support over 100 clients in building their strategy and growing their online fanbase.\n\nOur digital expertise has produced tangible results: over 1,500 campaigns launched, 34 million cumulative views, and solid engagement rates between 4 and 8%. My specialty: turning attention into a loyal, active community.\n\nToday, I apply this dual expertise—managerial and digital, data-driven and results-oriented—to help structure your teams and grow your project."
